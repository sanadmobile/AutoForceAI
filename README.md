## 🏗️ Architecture Stack

The system is composed of five main planes:

1.  **Control Plane**: `apps/web-console` (Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS) - *Includes CRM, Marketing, & Ops modules.*
2.  **Data Plane**: `services/digital-brain` (FastAPI, Python 3.10+, PostgreSQL/SQLite)
3.  **Execution Plane**: `services/rpa-worker` (Python, Selenium/Playwright)
4.  **Business Plane**: `services/ecommerce-core` (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy) - *Handles products & orders.*
5.  **Traffic Plane**: `apps/official-site` & `apps/ai-mall` (Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS)

### Installation Guide

#### 1. Setup Backend (Digital Brain)
```bash
cd services/digital-brain
# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
# Activate: .\venv\Scripts\Activate (Windows) or source venv/bin/activate (Linux/Mac)

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure Environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and DB details

# Run Server

# API will be available at http://localhost:8002/docs
```

#### 2. Setup Frontend (Web Console)
```bash
cd apps/web-console
npm install

# Configure Environment
cp .env.example .env.local

# Run Development Server
npm run dev
# Dashboard at http://localhost:3000
```

#### 3. Setup RPA Worker (Optional)
Required only if you plan to run browser automation tasks.

## � Quick Start

### 1. Create Enterprise & Invite Members
- **Create Enterprise**: After first login, go to **Organization Management** -> **Enterprise Settings**, click "Create New Enterprise" and enter the name. The system will auto-generate the default structure.
- **Invite Members**: In **Organization Management** -> **Member List**, click "Invite Member" at the top right. Copy the link or code and send it to your colleagues. They can join your workspace after registration.

### 2. Configure AI Middle Platform (LLM API Keys)
To enable the Digital Brain to think, you need to configure the LLM API Keys:
1. Navigate to **AI Middle Platform** -> **Model Management**.
2. Click "Add Model Provider" and select your provider (e.g., DeepSeek, ZhipuAI, OpenAI, Qwen).
3. Enter the `API Key` and enable the service.
4. Set the model as the **System Default Reasoning Engine** in "Default Model Settings".
